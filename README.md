```lrc
[00:11.63] Let's go back to the summer night
[00:15.54] When we met eyes, it's like a movie line
[00:19.48] Kissin' underneath the city lights
[00:23.45] But now you're laying in another guy's arms
[00:32.99] 'Cause I'm all gone
[00:42.49] 
[00:40.58] But when you look in his eyes
[00:44.53] Do you think of mine?
[00:48.26] And when you look at that smile
[00:52.30] Do I cross your mind?
[00:56.77] I know in your head
[00:58.68] You see me instead
[01:00.61] 'Cause he looks a lot like I did back then
[01:04.67] Baby don't lie
[01:08.20] He's just a lookalike
[01:18.70] 
[01:14.56] Can't redo what's already done
[01:18.75] Can't compete 'cause I've already won
[01:22.45] Sayin' this time, "It's really love"
[01:26.37] But honey, you're not fooling anyone
[01:44.37] 
[01:36.37] Don't you know we're done?
[01:49.37] 
[01:44.14] But when you look in his eyes
[01:48.27] Do you think of mine?
[01:51.97] And when you look at that smile
[01:56.08] Do I cross your mind?
[02:00.03] I know in your head
[02:02.13] You see me instead
[02:04.08] 'Cause he looks a lot like I did back then
[02:08.06] Baby don't lie
[02:11.72] He's just a lookalike
[02:22.22] 
[02:15.67] And I'll admit that I sometimes, maybe, might
[02:23.42] Think about you at night, well, almost every night
[02:31.06] No matter how I try to hide
[02:35.40] And erase you from my mind
[02:41.77] I'm dying
[02:44.73] To find a lookalike
[02:54.23] 
[02:49.06] 'Cause when you look in his eyes
[02:52.96] Hope you think of mine
[02:56.51] And when you look at that smile
[03:00.79] Hope I cross your mind
[03:04.73] I hope in your head
[03:07.02] You see me instead
[03:08.97] 'Cause you've been in mine every day since then
[03:12.82] Maybe it's time to find a lookalike
[03:30.32] 
[03:21.13] No, I can't lie
[03:26.74] I need a lookalike
